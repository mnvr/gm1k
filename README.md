### Generative music in less than 1K of Javascript

The prompt for day 14 of Genuary 2024 was to produce generative artwork that
uses less than 1K of source code. This is a generative piece that uses the
standard browser audio APIs to produce a neverending sound.

Live version is at https://mnvr.github.io/gm1k.

Source code for the demo is in [docs/index.html](docs/index.html) - it is a
standalone HTML file.

There is also a longer but more readable version in [docs/x](docs/x) with
explanatory comments in the source code on how to expand on this.
