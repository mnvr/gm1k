Generative Music Generator in less than 1K

The prompt for day 14 of Genuary 2024 was to produce generative artwork that
uses less than 1K of source code. This is a generative music piece that uses the
standard browser audio APIs to produce a neverending soundscape.

Source code is under the docs folder.
