### Generative music in 470 bytes of Javascript

The prompt for day 14 of Genuary 2024 was to produce a generative piece that
uses less than 1K of source code. This one uses the standard browser audio APIs
to produce a neverending sound using 470 bytes of JavaScript.

Live version is at https://mnvr.github.io/gm1k.

Source code for the demo is in [index.html](index.html) - it is a standalone,
470 character, HTML file. The song it plays is a remix of the Sierpinski Harmony
by viznut (the creator of bytebeat) himself.
