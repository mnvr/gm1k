### Generative music in 410 bytes of Javascript

The prompt for day 14 of Genuary 2024 was to produce a generative piece that
uses less than 1K of source code. This one uses standard browser audio APIs to
produce a neverending soundscape.

Live version is at https://mnvr.github.io/gm1k.

Source code for the demo is in [index.html](index.html) – it is a standalone,
410 character, HTML file. The song it plays is a remix of _Sierpinski Harmony_
by viznut (the creator of bytebeat).

See [x](x) for a longer version with more comments and explanations.

### Neverending Nights

The prompt for day 31 of Genuary 2024 was to produce a generative piece of
music. I made a neverending soundscape using only HTML/JS/CSS, no dependencies.

Live version is at https://mnvr.github.io/gm1k/e.

Source code for it is in [e/index.html](e/index.html) – a standalone HTML file
(you can just open it in your browser and play too). The song it plays is a
composition using Euclidean rhythms. The bassline and the trill rhythms are
`E(3,8)`, on which totters around the main Euclidean rhythm which cycles through
`E(3,4)`  to `E(12, 13)`.

I also wrote a tutorial about [Euclidean rhythms](https://mrmr.io/mj/euclid).
