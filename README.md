### Generative music in 417 bytes of Javascript

The prompt for day 14 of Genuary 2024 was to produce a generative piece that
uses less than 1K of source code. This one uses standard browser audio APIs to
produce a neverending soundscape.

Live version is at https://mnvr.github.io/gm1k.

Source code for the demo is in [index.html](index.html) â€“ it is a standalone,
417 character, HTML file. The song it plays is a remix of _Sierpinski Harmony_
by viznut (the creator of bytebeat).
